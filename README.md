# AR_Marker_Demo
An Augmented Reality app that demonstrates basic computer vision concepts such as greyscaling, thresholding, edge detection, homography, corner detection...its a long list. It paints a 3D image on any detected markers. <br>

 Here is a [ crude video ]( https://github.com/kperkins411/videodemo.mp4) that shows the application in action.  Here is a marker with the a 3D object (the CNU logo) rendered correctly on its surface plane.  Beside it is the marker with no image.<BR>
